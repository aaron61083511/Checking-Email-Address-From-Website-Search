# Checking-Email-Address-From-Website-Search
This python script is to help checking if the email addresses in the csv file match the records from Rice website.
I need to search each person's email from Rice.edu, so I made this script to help me download all the people's emails from the csv file.
Since rice.edu allows 10 web searches in 1 minute, I have to make the scrapping happen 10 people a group at 1 minute interval.
